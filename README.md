## rNVD3

This R package provides a familiar plotting interface for R users to create interactive visualizations using [NVD3.js](http://www.nvd3.org).

### Installation

`rNVD3` is still under development, and can be installed from github.


```
devtools::install_github('rNVD3', 'ramnathv')
```

### Usage

`rNVD3` uses a formula interface to specify plots, just like the `lattice` package. 


### Credits

Most of the implementation in `rNVD3` is inspired by [rHighcharts](https://github.com/metagraf/rHighcharts) and [rVega](https://github.com/metagraf/rVega). I have reused some code from these packages verbatim, and would like to acknowledge the efforts of its author [Thomas Reinholdsson](https://github.com/reinholdsson)
